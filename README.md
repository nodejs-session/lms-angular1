# Library Management System

This project aims at developing the Library Management System where a user can login either as a student or a librarian. A student can view all the books or available books, sort the list of books based on cost or topic and search a book using any field. A librarian can sort as well as search like a student, and also has the ability to Issue a book, Return a book or Add a new book to the list. This project is based upon a JavaScript framework called AngularJS and implements most of the key features included in the Angular package.
